            <h2>Denoiser</h2>

            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>The denoiser is clearly a very cool feature to program. At first, we had to
                modify the raytracer so that it also returns the variance per pixel. Indeed at the time of the
                generation of the scene, some pixels are much more "uniform" than others. The generation of
                image with the variance per pixel required a small adjustment in the ray tracer, but nothing very
                complicated. We simply had to add a second bitmap object and calculate the
                variance formula.</p>
            <p>
                The second part is to implement a denoiser that reads first the noisy output image
                and the variance per pixel. The implementation of this algorithm is in python and is located in a
                separate folder folder that I named denoiser. The choice was made for the fast version with
                convolutions.
            </p>

            <h3> Technical details : </h3>

            <p> Before writing the actualy python code for the denoiser, we need to render output two images. To render
                the image with variance per pixel, I modified the file render.cpp. Then I can compute the bitmap
                pixelVarianceEstimates using the two bitmaps sumBitmap and sum2Bitmap. The last step is to save the
                bitmap and we are done with this part.</p>

            <p>
                The second part is the python code. The denoiser can be splitted from the nori code, because it takes
                only two images as input and return return a denoised images. This is post-processing step in the
                rendering pipeline. The actual implementation was a copy paste of the pseudo code in the slides. The
                missing functions were created inside of python. The librairies numpy, scipy and opencv helped me to
                realize this denoiser. Some functions like
                circular shift and d2 had to be written by hand. OpenCV is mainly used for the I/O part of the
                part of the program. The program takes two mandatory arguments as input and displays three images,
                before save the denoised image for comparison.
            </p>

            <h2>Disney BRDF</h2>

            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>When I told my small cousin what I was doing, she had stars in her eyes.
                When I first read the Disney BRDF paper, I had a few tears in the eyes instead. Joking aside, this
                function was a real challenge to implement even though the final code looks very much like an
                microfacet function. For my part I implemented almost all the parameters except clearcoat and
                anisotropic. The implementation of the disney BRDF function is similar to the microfacet function, a
                implementation in three parts. For the implementation, I took inspiration from the following resources
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><a>https://media.disneyanimation.com/uploads/production/publication_asset/48/asset/s2012_pbs_disney_brdf_notes_v3.pdf</a>
                </li>
                <li><a>https://github.com/wdas/brdf/blob/main/src/brdfs/disney.brdf</a></li>
                <li><a>https://schuttejoe.github.io/post/disneybsdf/</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3> Technical details : </h3>

            <p>For the implementation of the brdf I created the single file disney.cpp. It contains the whole
                implementation. I also added GTR1 and GTR2 in the function warp.cpp.</p>

            <p>
                The first function I implemented is the evaluate function. Given a BSDFQueryRecord, the function returns
                a Color3f object. The first part of the function is a simple list of multiple easy dot computations to
                retrive different values for the next parts. Then we need to evaluate different Colors, namely
                Ctint,CtintMix, Cspec, Csheen. After we compute all values, we can start computing the differents
                components. At the end we combine the differentes components together.
                The first component is the diffuse part. The second is the specular part and the last one is the sheen
                part. For the specular part we need to sample the distribution function GTR2. I wrote the utility
                function in the file warp.cpp.</p>

            <p>
                The second function implemented is the sample function. The objective of this sample is to return a
                the value evaluated by the eval function, divided by the pdf and the cosine and return a new line
                in order to continue the recursive evaluation by means of this famous Russian roulette. In theory a
                uniform sampling would work without too much trouble with enough samples because it is not biased. In
                order to make the rendering look like better, importance sampling is a better choice.
                In my implementation I decided to divide the sampling in two parts. In the first part,
                we look if sample.x() is smaller than the metal factor or if it is not the case. In the first
                first case we do a CosineHemisphere sampling. In the second case, we sample the function
                squareToGTR2. The returned vector is considered as the normal vector and we make a reflection of the
                incoming vector on this new "normal" vector. I decided in this case not to take into account the sheen
                the sheen parameter in the sampling. Indeed this parameter has a relatively low value and
                I have seen several articles / implementations leaving it out. This allows to have a code base
                easier to read and debugging is also simplified.</p>

            <p>
                The last function to implement is the pdf. This function was not very difficult to
                to implement. The implementation of the pdf can be done exactly as in the case of the
                microfacet model. </p>

            <h2>Spotlight</h2>

            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>The third and last 5-point feature from me is a spotlight relatively similar to the point light. The
                difference between a pointlight and a spotlight is that the second one does not illuminate "all" the
                sphere but only a specific part of it near a direction angle.
            </p>

            <h3> Technical details : </h3>

            <p> The starting code is the one of my point light. I copied this code into the file spotlight.cpp. For the
                implementation of a spotlight, there are 3
                additional parameters. First of all, a spotlight has a vector which serves as the main direction, i.e.
                direction, which is the center of the spotlight. The next two parameters determine in a way the "size of
                the spolight". The first parameter cosFalloffStart is used to determine the size of the first cone where
                the lighting is almost complete. The second parameter cosTotalWidth draws a second cone that starts from
                the angle of the first parameter and ends at the angle of the second second parameter and the brightness
                will decrease linearly. The difference with the point light is that we add the function fallOff. This
                part of the functions attenuates the lights depending on the input angle.The details of the
                implementation are
                again strongly inspired by the PBR book. The code is similar to that of the pointlight. </p>

            <h2>Volumetric path tracing</h2>

            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>
                This feature is probably one of the most satisfying of the project to see once it works.
                The implementation was particularly difficult, especially the part with the integrator which took me a
                lot of time and energy. </p>

            <h3> Technical details : </h3>

            <p> To implement a volumetric path tracer, I had to implement three main components. In the first step, we
                have a medium. In a second step, there is a a phase function. Once these two functions are implemented,
                we can move to the last function which is the function which is the integrator and therefore the main
                part of the subject. The integrator works according to the free-path sampling method. </p>

            <p>
                In a first step, I started by implementing the phasefunction. Since I already had 60 pts of features, I
                implemented the isotropic phase function. It was in the end nothing really complicated. A toString
                function and a sample function that returns a pdf while filling a data structure a data structure for
                rendering. I created the file phasefunction.cpp for this. </p>

            <p>
                The second part implemented is the medium part. In my case I implement a homogeneous medium. The
                homogeneous part is easier than the heterogeneous part. This has greatly facilitated the programming of
                the sample, tr and inv_tr methods. No need to use complicated methods. Just some
                calculations with exponentials and logarithms. The equations are a reproduction of the
                slides of the course. </p>

            <p>
                The implementation of the integrator is quite similar to path mis. The difference is that you have to
                attenuate the ray by the medium and on the other hand break the path of the ray in the middle of the
                ray in order to give this scattering effect. For this we use the helpers functions of the medium and
                phase function within the integrator. The rest of the logic is otherwise similar to the
                path_mis. </p>

            <h2>Windowed sync filter</h2>

            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>
                The part with the reconstruction filter does not imply big modifications in the raytracer
                nori. There is a file rfilter.cpp with different reconstruction filters. We see for example that
                for example that there is an implementation of the box filter or the gaussian filter. In my case I have
                decided to implement a windowed sync filter.</p>
            <p>
                As for the implementation itself, I chose to use the code given in PBR books.
                The implementation is not very difficult. You just have to extend the reconstruction class filter
                class and then add the corresponding code.
            </p>

            <h3> Technical details : </h3>

            <p> I created the new class WindowedSyncFilter in the file rfilter.cpp. This class extends the class
                ReconstructionFilter. We have in this class two parameters, namely radius and tau. For the eval
                function, I created the sinc function and use it inside of the eval function.</p>

            <h2>Rendering on the euler cluster</h2>

            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p>
                To render on the euler cluster, the first step is to connect to the cluster, clone the project code and
                compile it normally with cmake.
                compile it normally with cmake. This is where the only difficulty of this part comes in. Nori is
                compiled with a
                graphical interface, namely the nanogui library. In order to be able to generate images on euler, you
                have to compile nori without this library.
                You have to compile nori without this graphical interface. </p>
            <p>
                To do this, I have generated a second program nori_euler which works without the graphical library.
                There are
                some difficulties though. The rendering is multi-threaded. The main thread does not wait for the
                the end of the other threads. This implies that we had to find a mechanism to synchronize the threads
                between them. My solution works as follows. In the main loop, we have a while loop that tests every
                second and exits once the rendering is complete.
                In the main loop, we have a while loop that tests every second and exits when the rendering is finished.
                It is very important to use the sleep function.
                Otherwise, the program will just loop and lose a lot of computing power to the other threads, which
                really need it.
                that really need computing power.
            </p>

            <h3> Technical details : </h3>

            <p> I created for this features the file main_euler.cpp. In the main function I directly create a
                renderThread and render into this renderThread. We must give the path to the xml file in the program
                arguments. When the rendering starts, I wait until the rendering is done. We sleep one second and read
                the status of the rendering again. When the rendering is done, we can print it and return 0. </p>

            <p>
                There is still another step to do. We need to modify the cmake file and create two programs. The first
                one is the normal nori with a GUI. The second program is the nori for the render cluster without GUI.
                There are two main files. The first is main.cpp. The second is main_euler.cpp.
            </p>
